Welcome to the workshop! In this event, we‚Äôll explore the power of JavaScript/TypeScript and Artificial Intelligence (A.I) to create innovative and intelligent applications. Get ready for an incredible learning journey where you‚Äôll become proficient in building effective AI-powered solutions.

Our goal is to teach you how to build a complete application from scratch using JavaScript/TypeScript and A.I, and then implement advanced features using modern libraries and frameworks aligned with Artificial Intelligence.

Throughout the workshop, we‚Äôll cover topics such as:

* Building a Next.js application from scratch using TypeScript + OpenAI LLMs through GitHub Models.
* Then, we‚Äôll implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture to enhance search and information retrieval capabilities.
* Using Agents for task automation and API integration.
* MCP (Model Context Protocol)

This will be an amazing journey where you'll have the opportunity to put everything you‚Äôve learned into practice by building real, challenging projects that integrate A.I in a smart and effective way. We're excited to see what you'll create!

## What will we build and learn?

A content generation application called: Microblog AI with Next.js

* In version 1.0

  * A modern, responsive interface using Next.js v15 combined with Tailwind CSS
  * Content generation with A.I using **[GitHub Models (OpenAI GPT-4o)](https://github.com/marketplace?type=models)**
  * Three different tones of voice: technical, casual, and motivational
  * Hashtag optimization and strategic insights, allowing you to share the generated content across various social media platforms

* In version 2.0: RAG Architecture with LangChain.js

* In version 3.0: Integration with Agents

* In version 4.0: Use of Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Agents

* In version 5.0: Application deployment using IaC concepts with Terraform, cloud provider of your choice (Azure, AWS, or GCP), Toolhouse, and using OpenAI‚Äôs API in production

* Visual Studio Code
* Node.js (version 14 or higher)
* Git
* Docker (WSL 2 for Windows users)
* Terraform

* Cloud service account (for app deployment). It can be: Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud‚Äîchoose what works best for you!

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

* ‚úÖ Create a Next.js 15 application from scratch
* ‚úÖ Integrate A.I into your applications
* ‚úÖ Implement a secure API with rate limiting
* ‚úÖ Build modern interfaces using Tailwind CSS
* ‚úÖ Use TypeScript in React projects
* ‚úÖ Deploy to Vercel or any other cloud provider like Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud
* ‚úÖ Apply development best practices

## ü§ù Workshop Support

If you have questions during the workshop, you can rely on various support resources, including:

* **[Next.js Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs)**
* **[React Docs](https://react.dev/)**
* **[Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)**

AI tools like ChatGPT are great for quick questions, and if you have access to **[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)**, be sure to use it to speed up your development.

I‚Äôll also leave a dedicated space in the project‚Äôs repository for questions. Just open a new **[issue](https://github.com/glaucia86/microblog-ai-nextjs/issues)** and describe your question. Over time, I‚Äôll create a Discord server to make communication easier.

Let‚Äôs get started?!
